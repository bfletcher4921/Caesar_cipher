# Caesar_cipher
Caesar cipher to convert "we attack at dawn!" (or any 15 char message) into coded message based on shift factor entered by user.
This program uses user input for the message to convert. User input is also used for the shift factor. ASCII ord and phrase position is used to add the shift factor. 
A message tuple is created for each position in the phrase and then printed.
This program project was assigned to our class to teach ASCII ORD and tuples.
